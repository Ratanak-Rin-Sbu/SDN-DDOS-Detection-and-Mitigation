# SDN-DDOS Detection and Mitigation Using ML and Statistical Methods

It has been known that Software Defined Networking (SDN) is the future of networking, allowing engineers to reroute networks on the fly. However, it can become vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Therefore, I did an analysis and wrote a research paper later on for my Computer Network course final project, which uses software such as OpenFlow protocol, Mininet, Ryu controller, and machine learning models including support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree in order detect DDOS attacks in SDN.
